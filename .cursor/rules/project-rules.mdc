## Details

This is a takehome assignment. I have two hours to complete it. Reference `CANDIDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for the requirements and details about the assignment.

## Stack

- Django / Python backend (reference `server/requirements.txt` as needed)
- Next.js / TypeScript / TailwindCSS frontend (reference `client/package.json`, `client/next.config.ts` as needed)

## Additional Details

- The comapny this is for is Upside (https://www.upside.tech/)
- I should aim to divide my time into something like ~20 mins of initial planning, ~40 mins of locked in development, and the remaining hour on polish and final improvments.
- While working, I will document my progress in the `README.md` with succinct thoughts for the team to reference when they review this.
